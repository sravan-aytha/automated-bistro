<p>In a village, lived a carefree boy with his father. The boy’s father told him that he was old enough to 
    watch over the sheep while they graze in the fields. Every day, he had to take the sheep to the grassy 
    fields and watch them as they graze. However, the boy was unhappy and didn’t want to take the sheep to
    the fields. He wanted to run and play, not watch the boring sheep graze in the field. So, he decided to
    have some fun. He cried, “Wolf! Wolf!” until the entire village came running with stones to chase away 
    the wolf before it could eat any of the sheep. When the villagers saw that there was no wolf, they left
    muttering under their breath about how the boy had wasted their time. The next day, the boy cried once
    more, “Wolf! Wolf!” and, again, the villagers rushed there to chase the wolf away.The boy laughed at the
    fright he had caused. This time, the villagers left angrily. The third day, as the boy went up the small
    hill, he suddenly saw a wolf attacking his sheep. He cried as hard as he could, “Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!”, but
    not a single villager came to help him. The villagers thought that he was trying to fool them again and 
    did not come to rescue him or his sheep. The little boy lost many sheep that day, all because of his
    foolishness.<br/><span>

<p>
One day, king Akbar asked a question in his court that left everyone in the courtroom puzzled. As they all tried to figure out the answer, Birbal walked in and asked what the matter was. They repeated the question to him.
The question was, “How many crows are there in the city?”

Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the answer; he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty-three crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied, “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more, then the relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities. If there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer, Akbar presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.
